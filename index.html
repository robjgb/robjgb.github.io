  <strong>Hi! I am a recent CS graduate from Cal Poly Pomona.</strong> Originally from the pacific island of Guam, I moved to California to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science. 
  Since then, I have gained experience in  <strong>web</strong> development, <strong>mobile</strong> development, and <strong>virtual reality</strong> technologies.

  <strong>When I’m not coding,</strong> I’m usually sketching art or making beats.
